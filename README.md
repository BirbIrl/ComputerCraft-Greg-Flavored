**Warning! The resource pack doesn't feature turtles** Turtles are removed in most greg tech packs due to them completely breaking all progression, and adding them has proven to be too big of a headache for me so they're not included :<zero-width space>(. There is an (optional) KubeJS script in the repo that removes turtles !!here!!

**ComputerCraft: Greg Flavored** is an easily customizable resource pack for [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) (required) that tries to fit the style of [GTCEu: Modern](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern) and [Greg Tech Refreshed](https://github.com/ULSTICK/GregTechRefreshed) (not required).

***As Well*** as a set of [KubeJS scripts](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS) used to integrate Computers into Greg Tech (not included in the curseforge/modirinth pages)
