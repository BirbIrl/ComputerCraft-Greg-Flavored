<span style="color:red"> <b>Warning!</b> </span>**The resource pack doesn't feature turtles, and the KubeJS script removes them from the game!** Turtles are removed in most greg tech packs due to them completely breaking all progression, and adding them has proven to be too big of a headache for me so they're not included :<zero-width space>(
