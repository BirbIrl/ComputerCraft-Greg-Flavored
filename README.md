**Warning! This resource pack doesn't feature turtles and doesn't work only works for Forge** Turtles are removed in most GregTech packs due to them completely breaking all progression, and adding them has proven to be too big of a headache for me so they're not included :<zero-width space>(. There is an (optional) KubeJS script in the repo that removes turtles from jei and crafting [here](https://github.com/BirbIrl/ComputerCraft-Greg-Flavored/tree/main/KubeJS)



If you're on **Fabric**, [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) is required with a shader enabled. Why? I have no idea. it just wont work, the render types get all messed up for certain blocks.


**ComputerCraft: Greg Flavored** is a family of easily customizable resource packs for [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) (required) that tries to fit the style of [GTCEu: Modern](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern) and [GregTech Refreshed](https://github.com/ULSTICK/GregTechRefreshed) (not required) with extra bloom support using [Shimmer](https://github.com/Low-Drag-MC/Shimmer) (optional)

CC:GF is ***Also*** as a set of [KubeJS scripts](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS) used to integrate Computers into GregTech that can be found [here](https://github.com/BirbIrl/ComputerCraft-Greg-Flavored/tree/main/KubeJS)
