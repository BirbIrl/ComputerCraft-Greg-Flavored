This texture pack is complete jank - it's my first modded resource pack and everything is stuck together with duct tape

Oh yeah, if you're looking for turtle textures - there is none. if you're playing greg you should probably disable turtles to begin with...

Most of the textures are modified GregTechRefreshed textures made by ULSTICK (thank you!)

This pack borrows some infrastructure from End_Rage's super cool computer craft create texture pack. If a json is signed by them - it was originally theirs and was probably modified by modified

If you make any tweaks or changes feel free to message me at @Birbirl on discord/twitter so i can update the pack for everyone. Thanks for checking this out!
                     
If you want to fork the pack, please don't remove End_Rage's signatures if you see me and work off the existing files. As for me, no need to credit me! I reserve no rights for this work.

Cheers! - Birbirl
